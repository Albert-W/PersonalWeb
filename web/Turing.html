            <h4>The following is Alan Turing's timeline:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1912</strong> Alan Mathison Turing born in Maida Vale, London, to Ethel Sara Turing (nee
                    Stoney) and Julius Mathison Turing.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1918</strong> Alan joins St Michael's day school in Hastings, where he does not do very
                    well. He is sent to Hazelhurst Preparatory School when he is ten where he does much better and
                    learns to play chess.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1926</strong> Alan becomes a pupil at Sherborne School in Dorset. Alan is not interested in
                    their traditional classical education as he really wants to spend his time doing Science and
                    Mathematics
                </li>
                <li><strong>1928 - 1930</strong> Alan enters 6th form at Sherborne and becomes great friends with
                    Christopher Morcom, another talented boy who loves Maths and Science. While they are applying for
                    university, Christopher suddenly dies. Alan is devastated.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1935</strong> Alan's work is so distinguished that he is elected Fellow of King's College,
                    aged only 23.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> Alan goes to Princeton University in America to study mathematics and is
                    awarded a PhD.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1939</strong> September - Alan is asked to join the Government Codes and Ciphers School and
                    arrives at Bletchley Park the day after war is declared.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1939 - 1940</strong> With Gordon Welchman, Alan develops the Bombe, a device for decrypting
                    the messages sent by the Germans using their Enigma machine.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1940 - 1942</strong> During 1942, Alan and his colleagues also manage to break the more
                    complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is a tremendous help to the Allies in the Battle of the
                    Atlantic.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1943 - 1945</strong> Alan is asked to work as a top level intelligence link with USA, which
                    he visits to share information on cryptology (code-breaking).
                </li>
                <li><strong>1945</strong>At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded the OBE for his wartime services.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1946</strong> Alan joins the National Physical Laboratory, in Teddington and he publishes a
                    paper with the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1948</strong> Alan is appointed as as Reader in the Mathematics Department of Manchester
                    University.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1949</strong> Alan is made deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester
                    University.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1950</strong> Alan publishes'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he develops the
                    Turing Test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent. The paper will
                    become very famous.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1951</strong> During his year, Alan is elected Fellow of the Royal Society FRS and also
                    gives a talk about Artificial Intelligence on the BBC radio's Third Programme.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1952</strong> January - Alan is arrested for gross indecency and loses his security
                    clearance. He is offered chemical treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment
                    has a very detrimental effect on him.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1954</strong> June 8th - Alan's body is found in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The
                    post-mortem finds that his death had been caused by poisoning. A half-eaten apple is found next to
                    him laced with cyanide. His body is cremated at Woking crematorium.
                </li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Turing 's infulence keeps going:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1966</strong> The annual Turing Award is established and given each year to a person for
                    technical contributions to the computing community. It is generally viewed as important as the Nobel
                    Prize.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1986</strong> The play, Breaking the Code by Hugh Whitemore opens in the West End and then
                    transfers to Broadway. The part of Alan Turing is played by Derek Jacobi who is nominated for three
                    Tony Awards.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1998</strong> A Blue Plaque is unveiled at Turing's birthplace in Warrington Crescent,
                    London (now the Colonnade Hotel).
                </li>
                <li><strong>2001</strong> A statue of Alan Turing is unveiled in Sackville Gardens, Manchester.</li>
                <li><strong>2004</strong> A memorial plaque is unveiled at his last home in Wilmslow, Cheshire.</li>
                <li><strong>2007</strong> A slate sculpture of Alan Turing is unveiled at Bletchley Park.</li>
                <li><strong>2007</strong> The University of Manchester renames the complex housing the School of
                    Mathematics and the Centre for Astrophysics as The Alan Turing Building.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> In response to a petition signed by thousands of people, The Prime Minister,
                    Gordon Brown issues a public apology in which he describes the treatment of Alan Turing as
                    "appalling".
